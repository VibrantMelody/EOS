A Firefox Recommended Extension!\n\nAbout TinEye\n\nTinEye is a reverse image search engine that allows you to search by image. TinEye uses image identification technology, not keywords: when you upload an image to TinEye, TinEye creates a unique and compact digital signature or 'fingerprint' for it, then compares this fingerprint to every other image in the TinEye index to find matches. TinEye does not typically find similar images; it finds exact matches including those that have been cropped, edited or resized. If you have never used TinEye, check out our tutorial.\n\nTinEye is perfect for:\n\n    Image verification: find out if a news photo is really what it claims to be, or if that dating profile is a scammer using someone else’s headshot\n    Image attribution: track the original source and ownership of an image\n    Image licensing: see if an image is available from stock image websites to be licensed\n\n\nUsing TinEye is private. We don’t track your searches, keep your images or add them to the TinEye index. The only data we collect is the version of the extension that you’re using. For more information, please see our privacy policy.\n\nTinEye Terms and Conditions\n\nHow to use this extension\n\nTo use the extension, right-click on any web image and select Search image on TinEye from the context menu. Results are displayed for you at tineye.com.\n\nTo set extension preferences go to Tools > Add-ons in the Firefox menu bar. Locate TinEye Reverse Image search in the Add-ons window list. Click the three dots on the right side of the entry and choose Preferences.
